  <p class="w3-center w3-large"> <b> Take control of your health and empower your life decisions. </b> </p>
<div class="w3-row-padding w3-center" style="margin-top:12px">
  <p class="w3-left w3-large"> iGene108 is an education and sequencing company with a unique brand of honesty, cyber security awareness, bioinformatic skill, and medical expertise.  We are fundamentally distinct from other currently available services in three important ways.</p>

</div>
  <div class="w3-row-padding w3-center" style="margin-top:50px">
  	
	<div class="w3-third">
      <img src="img/live.png">
      <p class="w3-large">Live.</p>
    	<p>1. Our primary mission is education. Unlike other companies that take your DNA, sequence it, and push it through an automated pipeline to generate a generic report in the form of a PDF, interactive webpage, or app, we go way beyond the PDF. We provide over one hundred minutes of face-to-face time with bioinformaticians who teach you how to visualize your own data, scientists who analyze your mutations with you, and physicians who discuss any concerns you may have about your sequence findings or your health. Unlike automated reports generated by other sequencing companies, our analysis of your DNA revolves around the idea that each person is unique in both their DNA and their desire to learn about their specific mutations.  We install a genome visualization tool on your personal computer and show you how you can look at your own sequence. From interactive computer modeling to hands-on visualization of your DNA sequence, iGene108 is unique in its primary goal to provide YOU with the education and resources that you need to empower you to take control of your own genetic information.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="w3-third">
      <img src="img/learn.png">
      <p class="w3-large">Learn.</p>
	<p>2. We utilize cutting edge sequencing technology to analyze the entire protein-coding region of your DNA, a method called “exome sequencing.” The human genome is just over 3 billion base pairs of DNA, present in two copies (one from mom, one from dad).  Currently, most other companies perform a type of sequencing that only considers certain specific positions in the genome previously found to be associated with complex diseases or genetic traits. These specific positions, known as “single nucleotide polymorphisms” or SNPs, make up at most around 1 million positions in the human genome. iGene108 provides a more informative, newer, and more comprehensive type of sequencing called exome sequencing. Rather than only considering a few restricted positions, exome sequencing targets the ~30 million highest-yield and best-understood base pairs that code for proteins in the human genome. This data provides much more information about rare, inherited diseases that can have devastating consequences for health. While there are now a few full-genome sequencing companies, one should approach these companies with extreme caution. While full genome sequencing technology is the most comprehensive, the science has not yet caught up with the technology. There is very, very little known about how to interpret mutations in noncoding DNA. Most of these other companies are associated with research labs and may be using your data for research purposes to begin to better understand this noncoding DNA. These companies may be charging you for gathering your entire genome data, restricting their analysis to infer those few SNP positions or coding positions (a “virtual exome”) that are well understood, using these few positions to generate automated and impersonal reports or apps, and exploiting the rest of your data for their own purposes.</p>
   </div>
    <div class="w3-third">
      <img src="img/together.png">
      <p class="w3-large">Together.</p>
 	<p>3. We are entirely client-centered, committed to providing your data to you and only you and empowering you with the tools to understand it. We have no secrets and no hidden agendas. We provide your aligned sequence and mutation data directly to you on a USB drive. If you want to bring a personal laptop, our bioinformaticians will help you install a genome visualization software that you can use at home to visualize your own sequence data whenever you wish. Moreover, as more becomes known about specific mutations affecting risk for disease you may be concerned about, you can search your own DNA yourself to find out if you have these mutations. Though we don’t keep your data unless you want us to, our physicians and scientists are also happy to meet with you again as new discoveries are made and re-interpret your DNA in the context of new cutting-edge research.</p>

     <h3>Health Information Security</h3>
      <p>Did you know that if you get your DNA sequenced through a research-affiliated company, it could become public information?  In fact, if any research institution uses your data and publishes any findings from it, even if it is part of a large study of hundreds of people, they might even be required to make it publically available.<br> Unlike a lost credit card, once you lose jurisdiction over your own DNA, you can’t just cancel the number and get a new one.  Each person’s DNA is as unique as a fingerprint.  More than just a fingerprint, though, it contains information about potential health conditions and traits now and in the future. Your DNA doesn’t just share information about your health and capabilities; it also shares information about your blood relatives including parents, siblings, and present or potential children and grandchildren as well.  This is priceless information that many entities--insurance companies, advertisement agencies, even potential employers--can misuse if they can get a hold of it.  Don’t get cyber-hacked!</p>
      <p> At iGene108, we are committed to empowering you and your family with your health information in a secure and honest manner.  We are an education and sequencing company, not affiliated with any research institutions, that sequences, analyzes, and provides your data to you and only you.  What you chose to do with your data afterwards is entirely up to you.  Unlike most research institutions that utilize cloud or cluster computing through the internet, we ensure your data is safe “off the grid” on physical hard-drives entirely distinct from any cloud or wireless storage or analysis platform.  At iGene108 we don’t have any hidden agendas or undisclosed plans to exploit your data or make it public. We simply want to provide you with the education and health information that you need to be able to understand your DNA. Let’s live and learn. Together. <br> </p>

     <h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>
<p>

What if my sequencing data suggest increased risk for a disease?
If we find anything concerning in your data, we will let you know that it is something to follow up on with your primary physician. Because we are an education company rather than a medical practice, we cannot provide specific medical recommendations or confirmatory testing. However, we will provide you with the data, information, and understanding that you need to empower yourself to take control of your health. 


Is my data safe with iGene108?  Will it be sold or used for research?
Your data is YOURS and only yours. We are an education company, not affiliated with any universities, research laboratories, or hidden agendas. We will NOT distribute your data to anyone, not even for research purposes. Because we physically give you your data, you can chose to do whatever you wish with it. Moreover, because we analyze all of our data in de-identified form and on physical hard-drives rather than a wireless cloud server, our storage is secure and hack-proof by any wireless means.  If you chose to have us securely store your data for additional time past your final consultation date, this is also done in de-identified form and on physical hard-drives rather than a wireless cloud server, i.e. “off the grid.”


How much do the plans cost, and do you offer any discounts?
We currently offer two plans, one of which is available at a discounted rate for families.  The “Education Only” plan costs $1,000 per individual over the age of 7 and includes as many or as few of the offered workshops as you wish to attend over the course of a year. Children under the age of 7, accompanied by parents or a legal guardian, are free in the “Education Only” plan. The “Exome Gold” plan costs $3,000 per person and includes over 100 minutes of one-on-one time (8 minute DNA collection, 60 minute bioinformatics workshop, and 40 minute consultation with our physicians) plus the “Education Only” plan for a year. We offer a family discount on the “Exome Gold” plan where the first family member costs $3,000 and every additional family member is discounted $250. So a family of four would cost  $11,250 ($3,000 + $2,750 + $2,750 + $2,750) instead of $12,000 for the entire family. We are happy to provide more details about the family plan.


How long does it take to get my exome sequenced?
You can expect the process to take anywhere from one to three months from your first DNA collection with iGene108 until it has been sequenced, analyzed, and is ready for you to learn to visualize it.  Wait times vary based on the quality of the DNA sample and the availability of the sequencing machines.


How do you collect my DNA?
We will collect your DNA from a cheek swab at your first visit. A swab will be gently rubbed over the inside of your cheek.


Can I bring my children to iGene108 events?
Yes! We have educational games and demos designed for children of all ages and encourage the whole family to sign up for our program.  We only ask that you or a legal guardian accompany any children at all times. 


I just found out that my relative/neighbor was found to have a mutation in a specific gene. Can you check if I have that mutation too?
Yes, absolutely, as long as it is within a protein-coding stretch of DNA (exome), we can check what your sequence data shows. Most disease-causing mutations that are well characterized and tested for clinically are within protein-coding DNA, so this should not be a problem. Before your one-on-one consultation with our physicians, you will be sent a survey by email to identify any diseases or genes about which you are particularly concerned or curious. Be sure to mention this gene in your pre-consultation survey!


Can I bring in my medical records to discuss with the physician?
Yes.  Because of privacy concerns, iGene108 will not keep any of your medical records on file, nor will we accept medical records in electronic or physical correspondence. Nevertheless, you are welcome to bring medical records and lab results with you during your visit with the physician. While we do not provide specific medical recommendations, we will work with you to identify the highest yield questions for you to bring back to your physician and can explain basic lab tests, medications, and disease pathologies. You will also have the option to schedule additional face-to-face time with our physicians, if desired, should you have more questions or concerns after your first consultation.


I am concerned about a specific disease that runs in the family.  Can iGene108 offer a workshop on the genetics of that disease?
Absolutely! We are here to provide education about the health issues that you care about. When you sign up for iGene108, you will be asked if there are specific topics or diseases about which you would like to learn. Our staff scientists and physicians will provide the most up-to-date information about these diseases, including cutting-edge research in the field.


Do you analyze cancer DNA?
Not at this time. Since we are not a medical practice, we don’t perform tumor biopsies.


I just read about this particular gene that was recently found to play a role in a disease about which I am concerned, but I have already finished my one-on-one consultations. Can you still tell me about my DNA for this gene?
Of course! Once you are a client of iGene108, we will continue to serve your genetic and educational needs. We are happy to perform this analysis, and you can schedule additional one-on-one consultation sessions with us even after you finish your “Exome Gold” plan time. Please contact us for our current rates.


I just had another blood test with my primary care doctor, but I have already finished my one-on-one consultations. Can you still go through the results with me?
Yes, we are happy to schedule additional consultation time with our physicians. We can explain the basics of your disease, medications, or lab results with you so that you can be prepared and identify the most high yield questions to bring to your physician. Please contact us for our current rates.


Where is iGene108 located?
At this time, iGene108 is based in Chicago, Illinois.  We are happy to discuss alternative meeting locations.


Is there an age limit for getting my genes sequenced?
No, but you must be over the age of 18 to consent to have your own DNA sequenced. If you (or your child) are under the age of 18, you must be accompanied by your legal guardian who will need to sign a waiver onsite.


Can you sequence my pet’s genes?
No. We currently only offer this service for humans.


How much do you charge for storing my DNA sequence data and additional consultation time?
Please contact us for our current rates.


Where can I find a document of your policies and licensing?
Please contact us for a copy of our policies.


How can I contact iGene108?
You can send us a message through the “Contact Us” form on our website. We are happy to answer any questions and provide further information.
